# Quine-McCluskey-Algorithm
Projec Goal: Design a piece of code that derives the minimum sum of products of a given function (i.e an array of minterms)

# WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Them aim of this project is to implement the Quine-McCluskey Algorithm in python. The first MVP is go get the algorithm working. Project functionalities may be extended in the future. Project code will be updated as more work is done. 

13/10/2021 - Implemented a function that converts a decimal to binary.
